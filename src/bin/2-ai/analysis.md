**Short Explanation:**

We are given reports consisting of sequences of numerical levels. A report is considered safe if the sequence of levels is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing, with each adjacent difference being at least 1 and at most 3. In Part Two, we can remove a single level to make an unsafe report safe. The task is to determine how many reports are safe under these conditions.

**Summary of the Approach:**

1. **For each report:**
   - **Check if it's safe:**
     - Compute the differences between adjacent levels.
     - Ensure all differences are either positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).
     - Confirm each difference is between 1 and 3 in absolute value.
   - **For Part One:**
     - Count the report if it's safe.
   - **For Part Two:**
     - If the report isn't safe, try removing each level one at a time.
     - After each removal, check if the modified report is safe.
     - If any modified report is safe, count it.

**Pseudocode:**

```plaintext
initialize safe_reports_part1 to 0
initialize safe_reports_part2 to 0

for each report in the list of reports:
    if is_safe(report):
        increment safe_reports_part1 by 1
        increment safe_reports_part2 by 1
    else:
        # Try removing one level at a time for Part Two
        for index from 0 to length of report - 1:
            modified_report = report with the level at 'index' removed
            if length of modified_report < 2:
                continue  # Need at least two levels to check differences
            if is_safe(modified_report):
                increment safe_reports_part2 by 1
                break  # No need to check further removals
# Function to check if a report is safe
function is_safe(report):
    if length of report < 2:
        return False  # Not enough levels to determine safety
    differences = list of differences between adjacent levels in report
    for diff in differences:
        if absolute value of diff < 1 or absolute value of diff > 3:
            return False  # Difference not within allowed range
    if all differences are positive:
        return True  # Sequence is strictly increasing
    elif all differences are negative:
        return True  # Sequence is strictly decreasing
    else:
        return False  # Sequence is neither strictly increasing nor decreasing

# Output the results
print("Safe reports in Part One:", safe_reports_part1)
print("Safe reports in Part Two:", safe_reports_part2)
```

This pseudocode processes each report to check for safety according to the given rules, handling both the original and adjusted criteria with the Problem Dampener for Part Two.
