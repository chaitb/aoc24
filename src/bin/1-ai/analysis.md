**Short Explanation:**

We have two lists of location IDs and need to measure their similarity in two ways:

- **Part One:** Find the total distance by pairing the smallest IDs from each list up to the largest, calculating the absolute differences, and summing them.
- **Part Two:** Calculate a similarity score by counting how often each number in the left list appears in the right list, multiplying each number by its frequency, and summing these products.

**Summary of the Approach:**

- **For Part One:**
  1. **Sort** both the left and right lists in ascending order.
  2. **Pair** elements from both lists in order (smallest with smallest, next smallest with next smallest, etc.).
  3. **Calculate** the absolute difference for each pair.
  4. **Sum** all the differences to get the total distance.

- **For Part Two:**
  1. **Create** a frequency map (dictionary) for numbers in the right list.
  2. **Iterate** through each number in the left list.
  3. **Lookup** the frequency of that number in the right list using the frequency map.
  4. **Multiply** the number by its frequency.
  5. **Sum** all the products to get the similarity score.

**Pseudocode:**

**Part One: Total Distance Calculation**

```
function calculate_total_distance(left_list, right_list):
    sort left_list in ascending order
    sort right_list in ascending order
    total_distance = 0
    for i from 0 to length of left_list - 1:
        left_number = left_list[i]
        right_number = right_list[i]
        distance = absolute_value(left_number - right_number)
        total_distance = total_distance + distance
    return total_distance
```

**Part Two: Similarity Score Calculation**

```
function calculate_similarity_score(left_list, right_list):
    frequency_map = empty dictionary
    for number in right_list:
        if number exists in frequency_map:
            frequency_map[number] = frequency_map[number] + 1
        else:
            frequency_map[number] = 1
    similarity_score = 0
    for number in left_list:
        frequency = frequency_map.get(number, default_value=0)
        product = number * frequency
        similarity_score = similarity_score + product
    return similarity_score
```

**Note:** In the pseudocode:

- `absolute_value(x)` returns the non-negative value of `x`.
- `frequency_map.get(number, default_value=0)` retrieves the frequency of `number` from the map, returning `0` if the number is not found.
- Ensure that both lists are of the same length for Part One. If not, handle the mismatch according to your requirements (e.g., process up to the length of the shorter list).
